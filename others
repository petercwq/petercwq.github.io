Iâ€™m passionate about producing easy-to-use mobile solutions. My background in Electronics, Information and Communication enables me to create wonderful hardware-software cohension designs that spark interests while my experience in cross-platform design and develop helps me sense and solve the complexity problems along the way. I take pride in delivering successful implementations despite challenges from requirements or limitations of technologies. While at Trimble, I have done work ranging from business analysis, software & hardware prototyping and design, configuration and development, solution architecture, and automation.
