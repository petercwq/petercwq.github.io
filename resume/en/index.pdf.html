						<h2>System Architect</h2>
						<p class="subDetails">2018/05 - 2019/02</p>
						<p>Project: CIS, Constrcution Information System</p>
						<p>As the technical leader of the project, I participated in the analysis of requirements, and
							was responsible for system design, architecture design, technology selection, business model
							design, task breakdown, front-end and back-end separation, ROA RESTful API design, technical
							document writing, etc. And also responsible for introducing agile tools to facilitate the
							development.</p>
						<p>Establish a unified foundation platform to manage construction information, including project
							and bid section information, project GIS data, progress, productivity, quality of each
							project job, and personnel at all levels, construction equipment, and their production data,
							etc.</p>
						<p>
						<ul>
							<li>Web Portal: SSO and sub-modules access points, vue + element ui</li>
							<li>Management Modules: User, Device, Project, Node.Js + MongoDB + RESTful API</li>
							<li>Business modules (including 3rd parties): integrated as microservices, and the specific
								business data is managed by themselves</li>

						<h2>System Architect</h2>
						<p class="subDetails">2016/04 - 2018/05</p>
						<p>Project: Overall Solution for Soft Foundation Treatment</p>
						<p>As the main technical leader, I participated in all aspects of the project, including PoC,
							field experiment, research, development, test, and product transformation, installation and
							deployment on-site, upgrade and function expansion, etc. This product has been
							expanded to support more than 6 different types of construction equipment.</p>
						<p>After a long-term field investigation and customer visit, a pile construction management
							system suitable for the national conditions is developed according to the customer demand.
							In the construction process of a piling machine, it will automatically and continuously
							monitor, analyze and record the pile forming parameters, that are required by national and
							industrial standards for quality assessment. And this is a very significant transfer,
							because the system not only acquires the data, such as location, depth, pile start time and
							end time, the sink-lift times, etc., originally collected by field operator through
							observation, but also many very important parameters that could no easily be collected
							before, such as instant current, force bearing layer current, filling coefficient, sink
							speed, fed gravel or concrete volume, etc. Through the acquisition, intelligent analysis,
							and processing of a variety of sensor data, the key parameters and the real-time data are
							uploaded to the management platform for further mining, statistical analysis for reporting;
							And this makes it possible for the engineering manager to control the quality, progress, and
							productivity, and even make a quick decision. Besides, the system's high-precision
							navigation ability could navigate the machine to the piling point quickly, without
							pre-stakeout, and improve the productivity of each machine dramatically.</p>
						<p>
						<ul>
							<li>System Components: Controller and Sensors (Embedded, C）, On-site Terminal（Win7, C#,
								WPF）, Data Communication, Aggregation and Analyze（C#, MySQL, Message Queue）, Web
								Platform（Bootstrap, Node.js, MySQL）</li>
							<li>Time Sync: The internal clock of the system is calibrated through GPS time, and ensure
								the time synchronization of multiple sensors and various system modules</li>
							<li>Sensors: Dual-Ant-GNSS with INS for RTK position（Horizontal&lt;1cm, Vertical&lt;2cm）and
								attitude（Pitch/Roll&lt;0.1deg, Yaw&lt;0.09deg）, Current Sensor, Weight Sensor, Laser for
								distance, Switch sensor for 0-1 signal, Rotary Encoder, Tilt Sensor, Flowmeter,
								Hydraulic sensor</li>
							<li>Bus: CAN, RS485</li>
